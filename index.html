    <title>Smartsheet for Elior North America | Strategic Initiatives</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Calm Harmony" - A professional and clean theme with a neutral base, deep slate for primary text/accents, and a gentle teal for interactive highlights, creating a focused and trustworthy feel. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive, single-page dashboard. The structure is non-linear, allowing users to explore content based on their interests rather than following the report's linear flow. Key sections are accessible via a sticky navigation bar. The core interaction is the "Elior's Initiatives" section, where selecting an initiative (e.g., Data Center Move) dynamically updates a content panel to show its specific challenges and how Smartsheet provides a tailored solution. This task-oriented approach is more engaging and useful than static text, as it directly answers the user's question: "How does this help my specific project?" It is supported by interactive charts for a high-level view of capabilities and value. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Elior's Initiatives (Organize/Inform): An interactive card/tab system. Clicking an initiative card updates the main display. This is more engaging than a table and allows for focused information consumption. Implemented with JS DOM manipulation.
        - Smartsheet Capabilities (Inform/Compare): A radar chart visualizes the comprehensive nature of the platform's capabilities. This provides a quick, high-level understanding of the solution's breadth. Implemented with Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Value & Impact (Inform/Persuade): A horizontal bar chart shows the key value drivers (e.g., Improved Capacity, Reduced OpEx). This makes the potential ROI tangible and easy to compare. Implemented with Chart.js (Canvas).
        - General: Key metrics are highlighted in large-font "stat cards" for immediate impact. All interactive elements use hover effects and smooth transitions to improve UX.
